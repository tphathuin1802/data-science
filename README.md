# Data-Science

## Overview

Data-Science is a repository containing my data science projects, showcasing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Built primarily with **Python**, this collection includes various scripts, Jupyter Notebooks, and datasets to demonstrate my expertise in extracting insights from data.

## Objectives

- Perform data analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights.
- Create visualizations to effectively communicate data findings.
- Apply machine learning techniques to build predictive models (if applicable).
- Document and share my data science workflow through code and notebooks.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**:
  - Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas (for data processing and analysis)
  - NumPy (for numerical computations)
  - Matplotlib (for data visualization)
  - Seaborn (for statistical visualizations)
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning, if applicable)
- **Environment**:
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Virtualenv / Conda (for environment management)
- **Version Control**:
  - Git & GitHub

## Installation

- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tphathuin1802/data-science.git
  cd data-science

- Set up a virtual environment:
  Copy
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  Install dependencies:
  bash

Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Ensure you have a requirements.txt file with necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn). If not, install them manually using pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn.
Usage
Open Jupyter Notebook:
bash

Copy
jupyter notebook
Navigate to the desired notebook (e.g., Project_Name.ipynb) in the repository.
Run the cells sequentially to:
Load and process datasets.
Generate visualizations or models.
Explore the output to understand data insights.
Refer to individual project folders or notebooks for specific instructions.
